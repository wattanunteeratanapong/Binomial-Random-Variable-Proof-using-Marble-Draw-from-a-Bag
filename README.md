# Binomial-Random-Variable-Proof-using-Marble-Draws-from-a-Bag

## Overview & Control Variable
- number of trial(n) in each scenerio is 10
- When we pulled the marble out of the bag, we just put it back in, so that it could be an Independent Trial
- Independent Trail make P(success) every trial constant

## Hypothesis
P(k n) is a probability of success k time in n trial <br>

### First Scenerio
Red Green <br>
Success is when drawing Red Marbel <br>
P(1 10) = 10C1 (0.5)¹(0.5)⁹ <br>
P(2 10) = 10C2 (0.5)²(0.5)⁸ <br>

### Second Scenerio
Red Green Blue <br>
Success is when drawing Red Marbel <br>
